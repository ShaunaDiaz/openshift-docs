toc::[]

{product-title-first} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-nodes in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

[id="microshift-4-18-about-this-release_{context}"]
== About this release
Version {product-version} of {microshift-short} includes new features and enhancements. Update to the latest version of {microshift-short} to receive all of the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates. {microshift-short} is derived from {OCP} {ocp-version} and uses the CRI-O container runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {microshift-short} are included in this topic.

You can deploy a {microshift-short} node to on-premise, cloud, disconnected, and offline environments.

link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

[id="microshift-4-18-rhel-image-mode_{context}"]
=== {op-system-base-full} image mode Technology Preview feature
* You can install {microshift-short} using a `bootc` container image. Image mode for {op-system-base} is a Technology Preview deployment method that uses a container-native approach to build, deploy and manage the operating system as a bootc container image.
+
See xref:../microshift_install_bootc/microshift-install-bootc-image.adoc#microshift-install-publish-bootc-image[Using image mode for RHEL with {microshift-short}] for more information.

[id="microshift-4-18-rhel-image-mode-image_{context}"]
==== Image mode for RHEL image added for use with {microshift-short}
* New for 20 March 2025: A `microshift-bootc` image is now available at the Red{nbsp}Hat Ecosystem catalog. For more information, see xref:../microshift_install_bootc/microshift-install-bootc-image.adoc#microshift-install-publish-bootc-image[Installing and publishing a bootc image to a registry].

[id="microshift-4-18-deprecated-and-removed-features_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features
With this release, the CSI snapshot webhook feature available in previous releases is removed. The webhook is replaced by CEL validation rules for snapshot objects.

//NOTE: Do NOT repeat bug fixes already noted in previous version z-streams
[id="microshift-4-18-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

[id="microshift-4-18-installation-bug-fixes"]
=== Installation
Previously, the greenboot health check marked some healthy Image mode for {op-system-base} systems as unhealthy due to a 300-second timeout, which was insufficient for systems with slow networks. Beginning in {product-title} 4.18, the default greenboot wait timeout has been extended to 600 seconds to provide more time to download images and ensure accurate system checks. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-47463[OCPBUGS-47463])

[id="microshift-4-18-1-known-issue_{context}"]
==== Known issue

* A failed greenboot health check flag does not clear when an RPM-install-based {microshift-short} service is updated without rebooting the system. As a consequence, greenboot health checks for optional components continue to fail because the `systemctl restart greenboot-healthcheck.service` command fails while the flag is present. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-51198[OCPBUGS-51198])

[id="microshift-4-18-2-dp_{context}"]
=== RHBA-2025:1953 - {microshift-short} 4.18.2 bug fix and enhancement advisory

[id="microshift-4-18-2-bugs_{context}"]
==== Bug fix

* Previously, a failed greenboot health check flag did not clear when an RPM-install-based {microshift-short} service was updated without rebooting the system. As a consequence, greenboot health checks for optional components continue to fail because the `systemctl restart greenboot-healthcheck.service` command fails while the flag is present. With this release, the primary {microshift-short} greenboot health check clears the condition that causes optional component health checks to continue to fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-51198[OCPBUGS-51198])

[id="microshift-4-18-11-dp_{context}"]
=== RHBA-2025:4249 - {microshift-short} 4.18.11 bug fix and enhancement advisory

Issued: 1 May 2025

{product-title} release 4.18.11 is now available, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2025:4249[RHBA-2025:4249] advisory. Release notes for bug fixes and enhancements are provided in this documentation. The images that are included in the update are provided by the {OCP} link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:4211[RHSA-2025:4211] advisory.

[id="microshift-4-18-11-bugs_{context}"]
==== Bug fixes

* Previously, {microshift-short} could fail to start on a host without the hostname RPM package installed. With this release, the hostname RPM package is pulled as a dependency during installation. This change means that the hostname RPM package is now required when building the {microshift-short} system, preventing this type of startup failure.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-54448[OCPBUGS-54448])

* In some cases, {microshift-short} did not start when using the default configuration file shipped in the {microshift-short} RPM because certain required values were missing. These values are now added to the default `config.yaml` file to avoid this problem and {microshift-short} starts as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-53026[OCPBUGS-53026])

* Previously, when embedding container images during a bootc build procedure, extended attributes were discarded, preventing the router pod from connecting to default `haproxy` ports. With this release, extended attributes are kept for container layers that are embedded into container images. As a result, the bootc container router pod starts normally. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42010[OCPBUGS-42010])

[id="microshift-4-18-26-dp_{context}"]
=== RHBA-2025:17912 - {microshift-short} 4.18.26 bug fix and enhancement advisory

Issued: 16 October 2026

{product-title} release 4.18.26 is now available, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2025:17912[RHBA-2025:17912] advisory. Release notes for bug fixes and enhancements are provided in this documentation. The images that are included in the update are provided by the {OCP} link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17657[RHSA-2025:17657] advisory.

* xref:../microshift_install_bootc/microshift-install-bootc-image.adoc#microshift-install-bootc-get-published-image_microshift-install-publish-bootc-image[Getting the published bootc image for MicroShift]

[id="microshift-4-18-26-bugs_{context}"]
==== Bug fix

* Before this update, embedding container images into a bootc build could fail because HTTP proxy environment variables were defined in the bootc image. Proxy errors occurred during container image embedding and prevented successful builds. With this release, the bootc image no longer sets HTTP proxy environment variables, thereby eliminating the issue. As a result, you can now embed container images without encountering proxy errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61433[OCPBUGS-61433])

[id="microshift-4-18-26-enhancements_{context}"]
==== Enhancements

* With this release, {microshift-short} uses OpenVSwitch (OVS) 3.5, keeping OVS synchronized with OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58139[OCPBUGS-58139])

* With this release, the `microshift-release-info` RPM now incudes example {op-system-base} Kickstart files for RPM, {op-system-ostree} and {op-system-image} installation types. You can use the Kickstart immediately for a faster installation, or customize it with your requirements. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42864[OCPBUGS-42864])
