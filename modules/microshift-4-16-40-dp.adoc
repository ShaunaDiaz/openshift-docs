== Bug fixes

* Previously, the greenboot health check was marking a {op-system-ostree} healthy system as unhealthy due to a relatively low 300-second timeout. This timeout was not enough on systems with a slow network. With this release, the default greenboot wait timeout is now 600 seconds, meaning there is more time to download images. This results in an accurate system check.
