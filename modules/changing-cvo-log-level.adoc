:FeatureName: Changing the CVO log level
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) log level verbosity can be changed by the cluster administrator. There are four log levels.

* `Normal` - The default log level. Contains working log information. Used when everything is fine. Provides helpful notices for auditing or common operations.
* `Debug` - Used when something goes wrong. Expect a higher quantity of notices.
* `Trace` - Used to diagnose errors.
* `TraceAll` - Used to get the complete body content of the logs.

[NOTE]
====
If `TraceAll` is turned on in a production cluster it may cause widespread performance issues and large log files.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
