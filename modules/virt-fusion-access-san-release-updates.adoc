== New and changed features

Image registry requirements for kernel module management::

{IBMFusionFirst} uses the {product-title} image registry to manage the kernel module. Do not configure the registry to use `emptyDir` storage because it provides only temporary storage and is not suitable for production use. Configure {IBMFusionFirst} to use a different image registry by creating a config map and secret after installing the Operator and before creating the `FusionAccess` CR. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPNAS-213[*OCPNAS-213*])

== Bug fixes

Filesystem creation button stays disabled until daemons are ready::

The {IBMFusionFirst} Operator was updated to check the readiness of filesystem daemons before allowing a filesystem to be created. The **Create file system** button in the web console now stays disabled with a tooltip explaining the condition until the environment is ready. This change prevents filesystems from appearing stuck during creation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPNAS-184[*OCPNAS-184*])

Filesystems cannot be deleted from the user interface::

The {product-title} web console does not support deleting filesystems. To delete a filesystem, use the {oc-first}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPNAS-217[*OCPNAS-217*])

[id="virt-fusion-access-san-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

Filesystem creation might fail during core pod deletion::

Filesystem creation might fail if core pods are deleted at the same time. The filesystem might be partially created on the LUN, which results in the following persistent error:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Disk <ID> may still belong to an active file system
----
+
No workaround is available. Contact IBM Support for assistance. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPNAS-233[*OCPNAS-233*])
