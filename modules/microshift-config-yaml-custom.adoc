= Using custom settings

To create custom configurations and enable optional services, you must use the {microshift-short} configuration file. The `config.yaml` file is read only when {microshift-short} starts. You can minimize system restarts by planning and making all of the configurations you need at the same time.

[NOTE]
====
Some configurations also require actions on the host or the creation of additional resources. See the documentation for each custom setting that you need to make to find additional instructions.

.Prerequisites

* You installed {microshift-short}.
* You are using a supported configuration of {op-system-bundle}.

.Procedure

* Make a copy of the `config.yaml.default` file that is provided in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, renaming it `config.yaml`.

* Keep this file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory.

* You can change supported settings by updating the parameter values in this file. Changes override default values when you start or restart {microshift-short}.

* Optional. You can also use configuration snippets to quickly configure settings.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You might need to restart applications and other optional services separately to apply configuration changes throughout the {microshift-short} cluster. For example, when making changes to certain networking settings, you must stop and restart all service and application pods to apply those changes.
