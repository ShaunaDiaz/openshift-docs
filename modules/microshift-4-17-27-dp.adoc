== Bug fixes

* Previously, an IPv6 configuration for {microshift-short} was created in the system at first start when an IP address was not configured. This was caused by an erroneous retrieval of the default node IP address because of the order in which the interfaces were listed. Consequentially, the misconfiguration resulted in the {microshift-short} service being unreachable. With this release, the correct node IP address is retrieved first.
