= The {microshift-short} YAML configuration file

During system start, {microshift-short} checks the system-wide `/etc/microshift/` directory for a configuration file named `config.yaml`. If the configuration file does not exist in the directory, built-in default values are used to start the service.

The {microshift-short} configuration file must be used in combination with host and, sometimes, application and service settings for advanced configurations. Ensure that each item is configured in tandem when you customize your {microshift-short} cluster.

To make one or two system changes, you can use configuration snippets. For example, if you want to add additional host names by using SANs, a configuration snippet is simple to use.
