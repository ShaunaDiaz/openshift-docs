= Updating {microshift-short} on {op-system-ostree}

[role="_abstract"]
You can have automated backup and system rollback in case any part of the update fails by using the `rpm-ostree` update path for a new or existing {op-system-ostree} deployment.

* You can update {microshift-short} on an `rpm-ostree` system such as {op-system-ostree} by building a new system image containing the new version of {microshift-short}.
* The `rpm-ostree` image can be the same version or an updated version, but the versions of {op-system-ostree} and {microshift-short} must be compatible.

The following features are available in the {op-system-ostree} update path:

* The system automatically rolls back to an earlier healthy system state if the update fails.
* You do not need to reinstall applications.
* You do not need to reinstall Operators.
* You can update an application without updating {microshift-short} using this update type.
* The image you build can contain other updates as needed.

To begin a {microshift-short} update by embedding the new version in a {op-system-ostree} image, use the procedures in the following documentation:
