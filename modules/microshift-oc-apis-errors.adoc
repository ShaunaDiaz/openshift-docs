= oc command errors in {microshift-short}

Not all {oc-first} commands are relevant for {microshift-short} deployments. When you use `oc` to make a request call against an unsupported API, the `oc` binary usually generates an error message about a resource that cannot be found.

* For example, when you run the following `new-project` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project test
----
+
The following error message can be generated:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Error from server (NotFound): the server could not find the requested resource (get projectrequests.project.openshift.io)
----

* When you run the `get projects` command, another error can be generated as follows:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get projects
----
+
The following error message can be generated:
+
[source,terminal]
----
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "projects"
----
