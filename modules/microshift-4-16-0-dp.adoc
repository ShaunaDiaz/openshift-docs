== Bug fixes

* Previously, the {microshift-short} load balancer controller tried to update the IP addresses of every `LoadBalancer` service in the node. Some of these services, such as those with a defined `loadBalancerClass`, have their own update procedures for external IPs. This conflicted with the {microshift-short} controller. Now, services that have a `loadBalancerClass` are filtered and IP addresses owned by other load balancer services are ignored by {microshift-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30833[OCPBUGS-30833])

* Previously, when `microshift-etcd` unexpectedly exited, {microshift-short} tried to restart so that `microshift-etcd` could restart, but there was a lingering unit fragment. Every attempt to restart `microshift-etcd` failed, making the system unusable. The `--collect` flag was added to the `systemd-run` invocation used to start `microshift-etcd`. The additional flag results in systemd cleaning up the unit fragment even if the unit failed. The system now recovers and restarts.
