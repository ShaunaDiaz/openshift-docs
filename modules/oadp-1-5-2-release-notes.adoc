== Resolved issues

*Self-signed certificate for internal image backup should not break other BSLs*

Before this update, {oadp-short} would only process the first custom CA certificate found among all backup storage locations (BSLs) and apply it globally. This behavior prevented multiple BSLs with different CA certificates from working correctly. 
Additionally, system-trusted certificates were not included, causing failures when connecting to standard services.
With this update, {oadp-short} now:

* Concatenates all unique CA certificates from {aws-short} BSLs into a single bundle.
* Includes system-trusted certificates automatically.
* Enables multiple BSLs with different custom CA certificates to operate simultaneously.
* Only processes CA certificates when image backup is enabled (default behavior).

This enhancement improves compatibility for environments using multiple storage providers with different certificate requirements, particularly when backing up internal images to {aws-short} S3-compatible storage with self-signed certificates.
