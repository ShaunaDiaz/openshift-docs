== Resolved issues

This release has the following resolved issues:

.`python3-requests` package vulnerability

A bug was introduced when building the {mtc-short} Operator for the 1.7.19 release. During QE testing, this bug meant that when attempting to install {mtc-short} 1.7.19 from the OperatorHub, the migration-operator pod failed during startup. The logs indicated that the Ansible Runner was crashing with an unhandled `KeyError: 'http+unix'` issue. The {mtc-short} Operator was in an incomplete state, and the required controller pods were never deployed, which rendered the Operator non-functional. This issue was caused by the `python3-requests` package.

The workaround was to downgrade to the last known working version of the `python3-requests` package, used in {mtc-short} 1.7.19, to `python3-requests-2.20.0-3.el8_8.noarch`. However, this action does mean exposure to the following vulnerability, link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4520[RHSA-2023:4520].
