= Optimizing the MTU for your network

There are two important maximum transmission units (MTUs): the network interface controller (NIC) MTU and the cluster network MTU.

The NIC MTU is configured at the time of {product-title} installation, and you can also change the MTU of a cluster as a postinstallation task. For more information, see "Changing cluster network MTU".

For a cluster that uses the OVN-Kubernetes plugin, the MTU must be less than `100` bytes to the maximum supported value of the NIC of your network. If you are optimizing for throughput, choose the largest possible value, such as `8900`. If you are optimizing for lowest latency, choose a lower value.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes plugin and the network uses a NIC to send and receive unfragmented jumbo frame packets over the network, you must specify `9000` bytes as the MTU value for the NIC so that pods do not fail.
====

The OpenShift SDN network plugin overlay MTU must be less than the NIC MTU by 50 bytes at a minimum. This accounts for the SDN overlay header. So, on a normal ethernet network, this should be set to `1450`. On a jumbo frame ethernet network, this should be set to `8950`. These values should be set automatically by the Cluster Network Operator based on the NIC's configured MTU. Therefore, cluster administrators do not typically update these values. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and bare-metal environments support jumbo frame ethernet networks. This setting will help throughput, especially with transmission control protocol (TCP).

For OVN and Geneve, the MTU must be less than the NIC MTU by 100 bytes at a minimum.

[NOTE]
====
This 50 byte overlay header is relevant to the OpenShift SDN network plugin. Other SDN solutions might require the value to be more or less.
