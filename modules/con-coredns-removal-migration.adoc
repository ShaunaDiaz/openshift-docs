= CoreDNS removal or migration

[role="_abstract"]
You can remove your CoreDNS integration by deleting the CoreDNS deployment and deleting your DNS policies. To migrate to a different provider, delete existing `dnsPolicy` CRs and re-create them with the new provider secret reference. No data is permanently locked into CoreDNS.
