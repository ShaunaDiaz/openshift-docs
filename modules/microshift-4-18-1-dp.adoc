== Known issue

* A failed greenboot health check flag does not clear when an RPM-install-based {microshift-short} service is updated without rebooting the system. As a consequence, greenboot health checks for optional components continue to fail because the `systemctl restart greenboot-healthcheck.service` command fails while the flag is present. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-51198[OCPBUGS-51198])
