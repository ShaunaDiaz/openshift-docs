[IMPORTANT]
====
Developer Preview features are not supported by {rh} in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features give you early access to functionality in advance of possible inclusion in a {rh} product offering. Customers can use these features to test functionality and give feedback during the development process.

Developer Preview features might not have any documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and have received limited testing. {rh} might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/devpreview[{rh} Developer Preview - Scope of Support].

== Extension SDK

The Extension SDK is available in {prodname} 1.3 as a Developer Preview feature.

The Extension SDK provides a framework for developers to build custom policy extensions that integrate with and extend {prodname} capabilities beyond core policies, such as `AuthPolicy`, `RateLimitPolicy`, `TLSPolicy`, and `DNSPolicy`.

Key features include:

* Building custom policy controllers that follow Gateway API policy attachment patterns.
* Integrating with the {prodname} control plane using gRPC over a UNIX socket.
* Using the Common Expression Language (CEL) for dynamic configuration evaluated against the Kuadrant context. For example, topology and request data.
* Publishing data bindings to share computed values or CEL programs with downstream components such as Authorino, Envoy WASM filters, or Limitador.
* Subscribing to cluster events to react to changes. For example, changes to gateways, routes, and policies.
* Accessing helper functions to query the Kuadrant topology within CEL expressions. For example, gateways and attached policies.

Example extensions and a developer guide are available in the Kuadrant community repository to help you get started with building your own extensions. For more information, see link:https://github.com/Kuadrant/kuadrant-operator/blob/main/doc/overviews/extension-sdk.md[Extension SDK].
