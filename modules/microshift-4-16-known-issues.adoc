== Pods crash when writing files that exceed memory limits

Because of an issue with {op-system-base}, when a pod tries to write files that are larger than configured memory limits to a persistent volume claim, the pod might crash with an out-of-memory error. The pod status shows `OOMKilled` when this occurs. Use the following workarounds to avoid this issue: link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7076169[Pods writing files larger than memory limit to PVCs tend to OOM frequently running on {microshift-short}](Red Hat Knowledgebase).
