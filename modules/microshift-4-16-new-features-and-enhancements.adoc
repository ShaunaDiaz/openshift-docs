[id="microshift-4-16-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
= New features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

//L3 major categories with features in each as L4s
[id="microshift-4-16-rhel_{context}"]
== {op-system-base-full}

* {microshift-short} {product-version} runs on {op-system-base-full} 9.4.

[id="microshift-4-16-updates-supported_{context}"]
== Update two minor versions in a single step

Updating two minor versions in a single step is now supported. Updates for both single-version minor releases and patch releases are still supported.

See the following list for details:

* You can update from one long-life-cycle version of {microshift-short} directly to another, without applying the intermediate version. For example, you can update directly to 4.16 from 4.14. Updating 4.14 to 4.15 before updating to 4.16 is no longer required.
* Now, you can focus on developing applications for your devices in remote locations and with limited bandwidth, rather than planning for updates.
* {microshift-short} offers in-place updates on {op-system-ostree} systems with automatic system rollback capabilities and automatic back up and restore functions.
* Updates of the RPMs on a non-OSTree system such as {op-system} are also supported.
* See xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-options.adoc#microshift-update-options[Update options with {product-title} and {op-system-bundle}] for details.

[id="microshift-4-16-custom-cert-auths_{context}"]
== Customizable certificate authorities for the API server are supported

With this release, you can configure a custom server certificate that has been issued by an external certificate authority (CA). The default API server certificate is issued by an internal {microshift-short} node CA. You can now replace this certificate with one that is issued by a CA that clients trust. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_auth_security/microshift-custom-ca.adoc#microshift-custom-ca[Configuring custom certificate authorities].

[id="microshift-4-16-audit-logging-config_{context}"]
== Configurable policies for log file rotation and retention

You can now configure audit logging policies to manage the retention policies for log files, ensuring that edge devices with limited storage capacities are not hampered by accumulated logging data. To configure audit log policies, use settings such as a maximum file size limit and maximum retained files to set a limit on log storage size. You can also choose an audit policy profile to specify the data collected. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_auth_security/microshift-audit-logs-config.adoc#microshift-audit-logs-config[Configuring audit logs].

[id="microshift-4-16-certificates-cleaning_{context}"]
== Support for cleaning up certificates

With this release, you can clean up custom certificates. For more information, see xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_auth_security/microshift-custom-ca.adoc#microshift-custom-ca-certificates-cleaning_microshift-custom-ca[Cleaning up and recreating the custom certificates].

[id="microshift-4-16-multus_{context}"]
== Multiple networks capability now available

With this release, using multiple networks is supported with the {microshift-short} Multus plugin. If you have advanced networking requirements, you can attach additional networks to a pod for high-performance network configurations. After installing the {microshift-short} Multus RPM package, you can use the Bridge, MACVLAN, or IPVLAN plugins to create additional networks. See xref:../microshift_networking/microshift_multiple_networks/microshift-cni-multus.adoc#microshift-multus-intro_microshift-cni-multus[Additional networks in {microshift-short}].

[id="microshift-4-16-configure-ingress-router_{context}"]
== Custom configurations for the ingress router are supported

You can now configure ingress routes to create access to multiple services inside your {microshift-short} node. You can use a variety of combinations to customize the endpoint configuration for your use case. See xref:../microshift_networking/microshift-nw-router.adoc#microshift-nw-router-con_microshift-nw-router[About configuring the router].

[id="microshift-4-16-configure-route-admission-policy_{context}"]
== Configuring the route admission policy now available

You can now configure the route admission policy to allow routes to claim different paths of the same hostname across namespaces. See xref:../microshift_networking/microshift-nw-router.adoc#microshift-configuring-route-admission_microshift-nw-router[Configuring the route admission policy].

[id="microshift-4-16-gitops_{context}"]
== GitOps with Argo CD now available

With this release, you can use the GitOps with Argo CD agent derived from GitOps 1.12 with {microshift-short}. Using GitOps means you can update a single Git repository and automate the deployment of new applications or updates to existing ones. You can also use your Git repository as an audit trail of changes so that you can create processes such as review and approval for merging pull requests that implement configuration changes.
See xref:../microshift_running_apps/microshift-gitops.adoc#microshift-gitops[Automating application management with the GitOps controller].

[id="microshift-4-16-support-updates_{context}"]
== Getting a node ID

With this release, you can get the ID of a {microshift-short} node. When opening a support case, you can provide the node ID to Red{nbsp}Hat Support to help in identifying issues with your node. See xref:../microshift_support/microshift-getting-node-id.adoc#microshift-getting-node-id[Getting your node ID].

[id="microshift-4-16-ssl-medium-cipher-suites_{context}"]
== SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites now supported

During an SSL handshake between a client and a server, the cipher to use is negotiated between them. With this release, SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites are now supported for the kube-controller-manager daemon, kube-scheduler control-plane process, and kubelet "node agent." This enhancement to the internal communication between Kubernetes components improves control plane communications security. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29037[OCPBUGS-29037])
