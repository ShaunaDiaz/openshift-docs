= Troubleshooting by using traces and logs

[role="_abstract"]
You can use a tracing user interface such Grafana to search for {service-mesh} and {prodname} trace information by trace ID. You can get the trace ID from logs, or from a header in a sample request that you want to troubleshoot. You can also search for recent traces, filtering by the service that you want to focus on.

If you centrally aggregate logs by using tools such as Grafana Loki and Promtail, you can jump between trace information and the relevant logs for that service.

By using a combination of tracing and logs, you can visualize and troubleshoot request timing issues and narrow down to specific services. This method gives you even more insight a more complete picture of your user traffic when you combine it with {prodname} metrics and dashboards.
