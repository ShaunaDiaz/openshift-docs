[id="microshift-4-17-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
= New features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="microshift-4-17-rhel_{context}"]
== {op-system-base-full}

* {microshift-short} {product-version} runs on {op-system-base-full} 9.4.

[id="microshift-4-17-IPv6_{context}"]
== IPv6 single and dual-stack IPv6 networking now available

With this release, you can run {microshift-short} and your workloads with either IPv6 only or IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack networking protocols. Ingress and egress traffic can be on either IPv4 or IPv6 traffic, mixed or parallel. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-nw-ipv6-config.adoc#microshift-nw-ipv6-config[Configuring IPv6 networking].

[id="microshift-4-17-LVMS-resource-footprint-reduction_{context}"]
== Resource footprint reduction for LVM storage driver now available

With this release, the resource footprint of the LVM storage driver is significantly reduced, particularly in terms of memory consumption.

[id="microshift-4-17-LVMS-volume-snapshot-deployment-optional_{context}"]
== Disabling and uninstalling LVM Storage CSI provider and CSI snapshot deployments now available

With this release, {microshift-short} can now be configured to disable and uninstall the container storage interface (CSI) provider or the CSI snapshot capabilities which can reduce the use of runtime resources such as RAM, CPU, and storage. See xref:../microshift_storage/microshift-storage-plugin-overview.adoc#microshift-disabling-uninstalling-lvms-csi-snapshot_microshift-storage-plugin-overview[Disabling and uninstalling LVMS CSI provider and CSI snapshot deployments].

[id="microshift-4-17-low-latency_{context}"]
==  Low-latency performance for applications now available

You can now run a {microshift-short} node with low-latency response rates. Using a low-latency {microshift-short} configuration with operating system tuning results in reduced application response times and can include deterministic performance. Using workload partitioning is also recommended. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_low_latency/microshift-low-latency.adoc#microshift-low-latency[Configuring low latency] for more information.

[id="microshift-4-17-workload-partitioning_{context}"]
== Support for workload partitioning

With this release, workload partitioning is supported in {microshift-short}. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_low_latency/microshift-workload-partitioning.adoc#microshift-workload-partitioning[Workload partitioning] for more information.
