== Bug Fixes

* Before this update, issuing the `oc explain` command for the `clusterlogging.spec.visualization` and `clusterlogging.spec.collection` resources did not list all the supported types in the output. With this update, the command correctly returns the complete list of supported types in the output for both the resources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6855[LOG-6855])
