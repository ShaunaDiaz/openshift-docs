= Updating {prodname} with the {ocp} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can update from {prodname} {version-1} to {prodname} {version} by using the {ocp} web console. Make sure that the {ocp} version you have is compatible with the {prodname} version you want to update to. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/RedHatConnectivityLink[Red Hat Connectivity LInk Life Cycle Policy] for details about version support and {ocp} compatibility.

[IMPORTANT]
====
On {ocp} 4.19 or later, if you are updating your cluster from a previous {ocp} version that contains Gateway API Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), you must ensure that these resources exactly match the Gateway API version supported by {ocp} 4.19. For more information, see the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html-single/updating_clusters/index#nw-ingress-gateway-api-manage-succession_updating-cluster-prepare[OpenShift documentation on managing Gateway API resources].
