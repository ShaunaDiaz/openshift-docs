== Bug fix

* Previously, a failed greenboot health check flag did not clear when an RPM-install-based {microshift-short} service was updated without rebooting the system. As a consequence, greenboot health checks for optional components continue to fail because the `systemctl restart greenboot-healthcheck.service` command fails while the flag is present. With this release, the primary {microshift-short} greenboot health check clears the condition that causes optional component health checks to continue to fail.
