== Bug fixes

* Previously, {microshift-short} could fail to start on a host without the hostname RPM package installed. With this release, the hostname RPM package is pulled as a dependency during installation. This change means that the hostname RPM package is now required when building the {microshift-short} system, preventing this type of startup failure.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-54448[OCPBUGS-54448])

* In some cases, {microshift-short} did not start when using the default configuration file shipped in the {microshift-short} RPM because certain required values were missing. These values are now added to the default `config.yaml` file to avoid this problem and {microshift-short} starts as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-53026[OCPBUGS-53026])

* Previously, when embedding container images during a bootc build procedure, extended attributes were discarded, preventing the router pod from connecting to default `haproxy` ports. With this release, extended attributes are kept for container layers that are embedded into container images. As a result, the bootc container router pod starts normally. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42010[OCPBUGS-42010])
