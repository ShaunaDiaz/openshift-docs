= About configuring Prometheus alerts

[role="_abstract"]
As an infrastructure engineer, configuring Prometheus alerts in OpenShift is a proactive way to tune alerts so that you can ensure platform stability. For example, you can set alert triggers for automated incident detection, usage, and cluster health.

* You can integrate the {prodname} example alerts into Prometheus as `PrometheusRule` resources, and then adjust the alert thresholds to suit your specific operational needs.

* For details on how to configure Prometheus alerts, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/monitoring_stack_for_red_hat_openshift/4.21/html/configuring_user_workload_monitoring/configuring-alerts-and-notifications-uwm[Configuring alerts and notifications for user workload monitoring].

* Service Level Objective (SLO) alerts generated by using the Sloth GitHub project are also included. You can use these alerts to integrate with the https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14348-slo-detail/[SLO Grafana dashboard], which uses generated labels to comprehensively overview your SLOs.
