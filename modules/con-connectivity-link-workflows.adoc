= {prodname} user workflows

[role="_abstract"]
Similar to Gateway API, {prodname} designed with specific user roles in mind, such as:
//Q: this does not match the gateway api docs, which list infrastructure provider, cluster admin, and app developer; should it?

* Platform or infrastructure engineer
* Application developer
* Business user

Each persona has a different way to work with {prodname}, depending on how that person is interacting with your {ocp} clusters.
