= About remote health monitoring with {microshift-short}

Remote health monitoring is conducted in {microshift-short} by the collection of telemetry and configuration data about your node that is reported to Red{nbsp}Hat with the Telemeter API. A node that reports Telemetry to Red{nbsp}Hat is considered a _connected node_.

*Telemetry* is the term that Red{nbsp}Hat uses to describe the information being sent to Red{nbsp}Hat by the {microshift-short} Telemeter API. Lightweight attributes are sent from a connected node to Red{nbsp}Hat to monitor the health of a node.

.Telemetry benefits

Telemetry provides the following benefits:

* *Enhanced identification and resolution of issues*. Events that might seem normal to an end-user can be observed by Red{nbsp}Hat from a broader perspective. Some issues can be more rapidly identified from this point of view and resolved without an end-user needing to open a support case or file a link:https://issues.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=12332330&summary=Summary&issuetype=1&priority=10200&versions=12385624[Jira issue].

* *Targeted prioritization of new features and functionality*. The data collected provides information about system capabilities and usage characteristics. With this information, Red{nbsp}Hat can focus on developing the new features and functionality that have the greatest impact for our customers.

Telemetry sends a carefully chosen subset of the node monitoring metrics to Red{nbsp}Hat. The Telemeter API fetches the metrics values every hour and uploads the data to Red{nbsp}Hat. This stream of data is used by Red{nbsp}Hat to monitor nodes over time.

This debugging information is available to Red{nbsp}Hat Support and Engineering teams with the same restrictions as accessing data reported through support cases. All _connected node_ information is used by Red{nbsp}Hat to help make {microshift-short} better.

[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} does not support Prometheus. To view the Telemetry gathered from your node, you must contact Red{nbsp}Hat Support.
