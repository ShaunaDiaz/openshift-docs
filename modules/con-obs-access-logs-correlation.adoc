= About using access logs for request correlation

[role="_abstract"]
Access logs give you detailed information about each request processed by the gateway, including timing, response codes, and request identifiers. For example, you can correlate requests across gateways, Authorino, Limitador, and backend services.

You can correlate request information with traces and application logs for a variety of uses. Request correlation uses `x-request-id` headers. These headers are automatically generated by Envoy for each incoming request. For example:

1. Access logs show the `x-request-id`.
2. Traces include the `x-request-id` as a span attribute.
3. Use a dashboard to jump from logs to traces and vice versa.

The following are most important access-log fields for request correlation:

* `request_id` (`%REQ(X-REQUEST-ID)%`): The unique request identifier generated by Envoy.
* `start_time`** (`%START_TIME%`): Request start time for time-based correlation.
* `route_name`** (`%ROUTE_NAME%`): The route that matched the request, which is useful for policy debugging.
