== Bug fix

* Before this update, embedding container images into a bootc build could fail because HTTP proxy environment variables were defined in the bootc image. Proxy errors occurred during container image embedding and prevented successful builds. With this release, the bootc image no longer sets HTTP proxy environment variables, thereby eliminating the issue. As a result, you can now embed container images without encountering proxy errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61433[OCPBUGS-61433])

[id="microshift-4-18-26-enhancements_{context}"]
== Enhancements

* With this release, {microshift-short} uses OpenVSwitch (OVS) 3.5, keeping OVS synchronized with OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58139[OCPBUGS-58139])

* With this release, the `microshift-release-info` RPM now incudes example {op-system-base} Kickstart files for RPM, {op-system-ostree} and {op-system-image} installation types. You can use the Kickstart immediately for a faster installation, or customize it with your requirements. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42864[OCPBUGS-42864])
