= Using configuration snippets

If you want to configure one or two settings, using configuration snippets is especially useful. Configuration snippets take precedence over both default values and a customized `config.yaml` configuration file. Add just the section of the YAML contents you need to the {microshift-short} configuration directory.

The following procedure uses the example of adding a host with subject alternative names (SANs).

.Prerequisites

* You installed {microshift-short}.
* You are using a supported {op-system-bundle} configuration.

.Procedure

. Create the YAML snippets you want to use based on the examples provided. Name them to run in the order you want them to.

. Use the `/etc/microshift/config.d/` configuration directory to drop in configuration snippet YAML files.

. To return to previous values, delete the relevant configuration snippet and restart {microshift-short}.
