= Migrating {microshift-short} from {op-system-ostree} to {op-system-image}

[role="_abstract"]
Starting with {microshift-short} 4.19, you can migrate your {microshift-short} node from {op-system-ostree} to {op-system-image} if the final versions are a supported configuration of {op-system-bundle}. Check compatibilities before beginning a migration. See the {op-system-base} documentation for instructions to migrate your image-based {op-system-base} system.
