= Simultaneous {microshift-short} and {op-system-base} updates

[role="_abstract"]
You can update your {op-system-base} operating system type and update {microshift-short} at the same time, if the final versions are a supported configuration of {op-system-bundle}. You can use following workflow to plan the general steps to take:

. Check for compatibility before beginning an update.
. Use the {op-system-base} documentation specific to your update path to plan and update the operating system.
. Enable the correct {microshift-short} repository to ensure alignment between your {op-system-base} and {microshift-short} versions.
. Use the {microshift-short} update type specific to your update path, such as using an RPM installation or embedding {microshift-short} into an operating system image.
