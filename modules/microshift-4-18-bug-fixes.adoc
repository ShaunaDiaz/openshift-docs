* Previously, the greenboot health check marked some healthy Image mode for {op-system-base} systems as unhealthy due to a 300-second timeout, which was insufficient for systems with slow networks. Beginning in {product-title} 4.18, the default greenboot wait timeout has been extended to 600 seconds to provide more time to download images and ensure accurate system checks. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-47463[OCPBUGS-47463])
