[role="_abstract"]
You can update {microshift-short} on {op-system-ostree-first} by embedding the new version of {microshift-short} on a new operating system image. The procedures are the same for minor-version and patch updates. For example, use the same steps to upgrade from 4.16 to 4.17 or from {ocp-version}.2 to {ocp-version}.3.

[NOTE]
====
Downgrades other than automatic rollbacks are not supported. The following procedure is for updates only.
