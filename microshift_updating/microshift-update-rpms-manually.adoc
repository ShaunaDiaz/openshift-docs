Updating {product-title} for non-image-based {op-system-base-full} systems requires updating the RPMs. For patch releases, such as {product-version}.1 to {product-version}.2, simply update the RPMs. For minor-version release updates, add the step of enabling the update repository by using your subscription manager.

You can back up application data as needed and move the data copy to a secure location when using any update type.
